# YOLO Model Visualizations

This folder contains visual representations of the YOLOv8 model used in the Enhancing Crop Disease Detection project.

The visualizations include:
- YOLOv8 architecture diagram
- Performance metrics graph
- Mathematical formulas with explanations

These resources provide a clear and comprehensive understanding of how our deep learning model works to identify and classify crop diseases.
